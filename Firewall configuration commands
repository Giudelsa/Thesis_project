Enabling the NAT 

In order to let the modem/router of the main network know the new SmartHome network, we should configure one static route. Instead, we prefer to masquerade the addresses that leave the eth0 interface of our firewall.
 
To enable the NAT functionality, use the following command:
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

Then, to allow devices connected to the SmartHome to create connections with Internet and the main network use the command:
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT

And to deny connections originated from Internet or the main network to the SmartHome network use:
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

So now, the connection has to be initialized from the SmartHome network and all the others will be discarded.


Firewall configuration:

In order to avoid communication between Home network and IoT network we set the following rules:
sudo iptables -A FORWARD  -d 192.168.0.0/24  -j DROP 
sudo iptables -A FORWARD  -s 192.168.0.0/24  -j DROP

Then to deny packets from outside the network with the sensor as destination:
sudo iptables -A FORWARD ! -s 192.168.2.0/24 -d 192.168.2.45/32 -j DROP

and to deny packets from the sensor to the Internet: 
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.2.45/32 ! -d 192.168.2.0/24 -j DROP
